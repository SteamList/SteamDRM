DRM Database
<a href="http://www.drmdatabase.net/">http://www.drmdatabase.net/</a>

This is a site whose goal is to document <i>all</i> DRM schemes for <i>every</i> game, rather than games for a single distribution channel.

DRM Database is also powered by user contributions, with contributions being done through a <a href="http://www.drmdatabase.net/submitgame">submission form</a>.
