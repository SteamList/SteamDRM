FAQ
<strong>Q:</strong> What is DRM and why are you tracking it?<br /><strong>A:</strong> This is best explained by directing you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>. It&#8217;s long, but the only parts you need to read are the first two paragraphs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Computer_games" target="_blank">Section 2.4: Computer games</a>.
<strong>Q:</strong> How do I find DRM?<br /><strong>A:</strong> As previously mentioned, this list is user created. Because of this, it is up to the community to find games with DRM. There are many ways to find DRM, and they will be listed here. It is suggested you try all possible methods of detecting DRM, as one method alone is not always sufficient (for example, Far Cry 2&#8242;s store page lists DRM despite only having inert SecuROM files).
<ul><li>The Steam store page. It will either be listed in the <a href="images/GameDetails.png" target="_blank">game details</a> or the <a href="images/SysReqs.png" target="_blank">system requirements</a>. CrazyTerabyte has also written a great <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/74040" target="_blank">userscript</a> that identifies and highlights key DRM words on Steam pages automatically.</li><li>For account-based DRM, it&#8217;s pretty obvious. You&#8217;ll have to register/log in at some point.</li><li><a href="http://pid.gamecopyworld.com/" target="_blank">Protection iD</a> is a neat program that detects an unbelievably large amount of copy protection schemes.</li><li>Checking the game folders and registry entries for certain files is also helpful. For example, SecuROM usually contains a <a href="images/Paul.png" target="_blank">&#8220;paul.dll&#8221;</a> along with the game&#8217;s executable file. However, it should be noted that this can only confirm inert files; the only accurate method is to use Protection iD and using the DRM scheme&#8217;s tools.</li></ul>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh, no! I found a game with DRM on it! What do I do?<br /><strong>A:</strong> You can contact me in 4 different ways:
<ul><li><a href="mailto:flibitijibibo@flibitijibibo.com">E-mail me</a>.</li><li>Post in the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1537801" target="_blank">Steam Forum Thread</a>.</li><li>Message me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/steamdrm" target="_blank">@steamdrm</a> on Twitter.</li><li>Make a pull request at <a href="https://github.com/SteamList/SteamDRM">GitHub</a>.</li></ul>
Please be sure to give me ALL of the information you possibly can. I will need VERY good evidence without official documentation from a developer/publisher.
<strong>Q:</strong> What are the DRM list categories and why are they there?<br /><strong>A:</strong> The categories are Account-based DRM, Hardware-based DRM, Inert DRM, and Removed DRM. This is done to organize the numerous types of DRM for a number of reasons. Not only do they work differently on a technical level, but many people have different opinions about certain types of DRM. For example, one user may dislike hardware-based DRM but not have any problem with account-based DRM. The differences are explained at the beginning of each section&#8217;s page.
<strong>Q:</strong> Who created this site?<br /><strong>A:</strong> The site itself was created by flibitijibibo, but the content was maintained by several others before him (on top of the contributions made by dozens of others). If for some reason you&#8217;re more curious about flibit, <a href="http://www.flibitijibibo.com/" target="_blank">this is his personal site</a>.
<strong>Q:</strong> Something something DRM something something bad/good etc.<br /><strong>A:</strong> This is not relevant to this list. You and I could go on for hours about the technological problems and semantics of DRM, but this is only here to document something that the Steam store has not. Take this discussion elsewhere, please.
