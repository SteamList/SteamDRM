FAQ
<strong>Q:</strong> What is DRM and why are you tracking it?<br /><strong>A:</strong> This is best explained by directing you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>. It&#8217;s long, but the only parts you need to read are the first two paragraphs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Computer_games" target="_blank">Section 2.4: Computer games</a>.
<strong>Q:</strong> How do I find DRM?<br /><strong>A:</strong> As previously mentioned, this list is user created. Because of this, it is up to the community to find games with DRM. There are many ways to find DRM, and they will be listed here. It is suggested you try all possible methods of detecting DRM, as one method alone is not always sufficient (for example, Far Cry 2&#8242;s store page lists DRM despite only having inert SecuROM files).
<ul><li>The Steam store page. It will either be listed in the <a href="../images/GameDetails.png" target="_blank">game details</a> or the <a href="../images/SysReqs.png" target="_blank">system requirements</a>. CrazyTerabyte has also written a great <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/74040" target="_blank">userscript</a> that identifies and highlights key DRM words on Steam pages automatically.</li><li>For account-based DRM, it&#8217;s pretty obvious. You&#8217;ll have to register/log in at some point.</li><li><a href="http://pid.gamecopyworld.com/" target="_blank">Protection iD</a> is a neat program that detects an unbelievably large amount of copy protection schemes.</li><li>Checking the game folders and registry entries for certain files is also helpful. For example, SecuROM usually contains a <a href="../images/Paul.png" target="_blank">&#8220;paul.dll&#8221;</a> along with the game&#8217;s executable file. However, it should be noted that this can only confirm inert files; the only accurate method is to use Protection iD and using the DRM scheme&#8217;s tools.</li></ul>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh, no! I found a game with DRM on it! What do I do?<br /><strong>A:</strong> You can contact me in 3 different ways:
<ul><li><a href="mailto:flibitijibibo@flibitijibibo.com">E-mail me</a>.</li><li>Post in the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1537801" target="_blank">Steam Forum Thread</a>.</li><li>Message me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/steamdrm" target="_blank">@steamdrm</a> on Twitter.</li></ul>
Please be sure to give me ALL of the information you possibly can. I will need VERY good evidence without official documentation from a developer/publisher.
<strong>Q:</strong> What are the DRM list categories and why are they there?<br /><strong>A:</strong> The categories are Account-based DRM, Hardware-based DRM, Inert DRM, and DRM removed. This is done to organize the numerous types of DRM for a number of reasons. Not only do they work differently on a technical level, but many people have different opinions about certain types of DRM. For example, one user may dislike hardware-based DRM but not have any problem with account-based DRM. The differences are explained at the beginning of each section&#8217;s page.
<strong>Q:</strong> Who is running this site?<br /><strong>A:</strong> I go by flibitijibibo, but you can call me flibit. You know, more informal. If for some reason you&#8217;re more curious about me, <a href="http://www.flibitijibibo.com/" target="_blank">this is where I type my own personal mess</a>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Controversy</strong></span>
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIG OL&#8217; DISCLAIMER:</span></em> </strong>This portion of the FAQ does not necessarily express the views of those for, against, or even indifferent towards DRM. This is written by one person attempting to calm the argument.
<strong>Q:</strong> Why do you guys care about DRM so much?<br /><strong>A:</strong> There are a number of reasons from different people. The general consensus is that it&#8217;s invasive and does malicious things to your computer (i.e. SecuROM installing a rootkit). As for a personal example, I&#8217;m an advocate of <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">free/libre software</a>, so to me, DRM does nothing but attack progress towards freedom.
Many people get aggressive on both sides of this argument. I do not like to think less of a person for buying products they desire. It is only bothersome if they haven&#8217;t done their homework.
<strong>Q:</strong> *DRM scheme here* isn&#8217;t broken! It hasn&#8217;t happened to me!<br /><strong>A:</strong> This is a classic example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_accident" target="_blank">converse accident</a>. DRM is broken, but not to the extent that it happens to everybody. However, the fact that it CAN be broken on the level that it has is what concerns us. Whether you&#8217;re for or against DRM, please do not use this very popular logical fallacy.
<strong>Q:</strong> Publishers/developers have the right to put what they want on their products, you know.<br /><strong>A:</strong> Indeed! And we have the right to boycott it!
<strong>Q:</strong> Steam is DRM too!<br /><strong>A:</strong> You&#8217;re half right. Steam is a massive service, and DRM is simply a part of it. Not only does it have a significantly higher success rate, but the support is much better and it actually offers the user something in return. Even if Steam were to become intrusive, the DRM method is so simple that the means to break the handcuffs is significantly easier and is less likely to put your computer at risk (even with Steam in the equation).
<strong>Q:</strong> Okay, smart guy, what do YOU think about DRM? You&#8217;re running this thing, after all&#8230;<br /><strong>A:</strong> I believe that there is some good in having some type of account that manages games, but under no circumstances should that interfere with consumer rights. However, my personal opinion is irrelevant to this list.
