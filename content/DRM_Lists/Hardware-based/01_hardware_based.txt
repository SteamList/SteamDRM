Hardware-based
Hardware-based DRM uses the PC itself in the activation process. The DRM, when installed, will usually check the system specs, operating system, image mounting software, etc. When any of these things are modified, the activation considers the PC to be a different one and will require another activation. If an activation limit exists and is reached, the game will refuse to install or play. In some cases, there will be methods to either revoke activations or reset the limit. These will be noted at the bottom of this page.
