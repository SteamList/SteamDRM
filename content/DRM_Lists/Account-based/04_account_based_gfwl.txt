Account-based: Games for Windows Live
There are two kinds of GFWL activation:
<b>Current method:</b> Server-Side Activation, or SSA. This binds the CD key permanently to your GFWL account, similarly to Steam. Thanks to this feature, the games do not carry activation limits! On top of this, a new GFWL feature has been added: Zero Day Piracy Protection (or ZDPP). This is their attempt to prevent pre-release copies from being played, and it can only be applied to SSA games.
<b>Legacy method:</b> A simple CD key check. This still requires an Internet connection, but it does not tie the key to your account. This has an activation limit between 10-20 (usually 15), similar to the usual Microsoft products (such as Office). If you hit the limit, contact Microsoft support. With proper evidence they will give you a new key, but you are only allowed one more key. After that, you will need to buy the game again.
It should also be noted that GFWL is not supported worldwide. In the event that you bind an SSA key to an account that is not in a supported region, you will lose the key (and, consequently, access to the game).
